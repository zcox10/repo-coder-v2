  """Returns an attention head for categorical inputs.

  Assumes the existence of a beginning of sequence token and attends to it
  always with strength 0.5*softmax_coldness. This allows to implement an
  arbitrary default value for rows in the attention pattern that are all-zero.

  Attends to the BOS token if all other key-query pairs have zero attention.
  Hence, the first value in the value sequence will be the default output for
  such cases.

  Args:
    query_space: Vector space containing (categorical) query input.
    key_space: Vector space containing (categorical) key input.
    value_space: Vector space containing (numerical) value input.
    output_space: Vector space which will contain (numerical) output.
    bos_space: 1-d space used to identify the beginning of sequence token.
    one_space: 1-d space which contains 1 at every position.
    attn_fn: A selector function f(query, key) operating on the query/key basis
      directions that defines the attention pattern.
    default_output: Output to return if attention pattern is all zero.
    causal: If True, use masked attention.
    always_attend_to_bos: If True, always attend to the BOS token. If False,
      only attend to BOS when attending to nothing else.
    use_bos_for_default_output: If True, assume BOS is not in the value space
      and output a default value when attending to BOS. If False, assume BOS is
      in the value space, and map it to the output space like any other token.
    softmax_coldness: The inverse temperature of the softmax. Default value is
      high which makes the attention close to a hard maximum.

    # We want to enforce the following property on our attention patterns:
    # - if nothing else is attended to, attend to the BOS token.
    # - otherwise, don't attend to the BOS token.
    #
    # We assume that the BOS position always only contains the vector bos + one,
    # and that any other position has bos coefficient 0.
    #
    # We do this as follows:
    # Let Q and K be subspaces of V containing the query and key vectors,
    # both disjoint with the BOS space {bos} or the one space {one}.
    # Suppose we have an attn_fn which defines a bilinear W_QK: V x V -> ℝ,
    # s.t. W_QK(q, k) = 0 whenever either q or k are bos or one.
    #
    # Then define W_new: V x V -> ℝ st:
    # W_new(one, bos) = 0.5, otherwise 0.
    #
    # Now set W_QK' = W_QK + W_new.
    #
    # To evaluate the attention to the BOS position:
    # W_QK'(q, bos + one)
    # = W_QK'(q, bos) + W_QK'(q, one)
    # = W_QK(q, bos) + W_QK(q, one) + W_new(q, bos) + W_new(q, one)
    # = 0            + 0            + W_new(q, bos) + W_new(q, one)
    # = W_new(q, bos) + W_new(q, one)
    # = W_new(q' + one, bos) + W_new(q' + one, one)  where q = one + q'
    # = W_new(q', bos) + W_new(one, bos) + W_new(q', one) + W_new(one, one)
    # = 0              + 0.5             + 0              + 0
    # = 0.5
    #
    # To evaluate the attention to a non-BOS position:
    # W_QK'(0 * bos + q, 0 * bos + k)  # s.t. q ∈ Q+{one}, k ∈ K+{one}
    # = 0*W_QK'(bos, 0*bos + k) + W_QK'(q, 0*bos + k)
    # = W_QK'(q, 0*bos + k)
    # = 0*W_QK'(q, bos) + W_QK'(q, k)
    # = W_QK'(q, k)
    # = W_QK(q, k)    since W_QK' = W_QK on inputs not containing bos.
    # = W_QK(q', k')  since W_QK(x, y) = 0 whenever x or y are one.
    #
    # Since W_QK(q, k) takes values in 0, 1, a sufficiently high softmax
    # coldness will give us the desired property.                            QED
    #
    # The following implements this idea.
    # By replacing 0.5 with 1, we can instead enforce a different property: that
    # the BOS token is always attended to in addition to whatever else.
